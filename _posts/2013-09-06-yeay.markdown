This is our first post using Jekyll! We should celebrate! I'm not really in the mood for writing a super detailed first article right now, so this is by far the best you'll get from me today. And tomorrow too. So yeah. Jekyll. Nice. I'm so proud. Really. It's like I was a dad, and the baby was this beautiful website. No, wait, it's like if I was pregnant and get this website for baby. So glad! I'd cry if I wasn't so good at being manly everywhere.


Whatever.
